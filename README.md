# optify
Simplifies getting the right configuration options for a process using pre-loaded configurations from files to manage options for experiments or flights.

See [tests](./tests/) for examples and tests for different implementations of this format for managing options.

# .NET
See [github.com/juharris/dotnet-OptionsProvider](https://github.com/juharris/dotnet-OptionsProvider) for an equivalent library with dependency injection support.

# Ruby
Coming soon and it will be built using the Rust implementation.

# Rust
See the [rust](./rust/) folder.
Not intended to be used for other Rust projects as it's mainly made to support building implementations for other languages such as Node.js, Python, and Ruby.
