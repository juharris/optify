Most projects should either always use constraints in every request or never use constraints in order to avoid confusion.\n\nConditions cannot be used in imported features. This helps keep retrieving and building configuration options for a list of features fast and more predictable because imports do not need to be re-evaluated. Instead, keep each feature file as granular and self-contained as possible, then use conditions and import the required granular features in a feature file that defines a common scenario.\n\n See https://github.com/juharris/optify?tab=readme-ov-file#conditions for more information and examples."
